# Measuring skill in outputting damage

In August of 2017, [Riot released a new statistic called "damage rating"](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/introducing-damage-rating-better-metric-track-damage). This new statistic is based off of the old statistic, `damage to champs per minute`, adjusted for champion, game result, and time spent around enemies. They note that one of the weaknesses of the statistic is that it is not adjusted for game length.
